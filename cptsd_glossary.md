# CPTSD Glossary: Key Terms and Definitions

## A

**Affective Dysregulation**
The difficulty in controlling emotional responses. In CPTSD, individuals may experience extreme emotional reactions to minor triggers, including sudden anger, sadness, or anxiety. This symptom reflects the nervous system's heightened reactivity to perceived threats.

**Avoidance**
A coping mechanism where individuals actively avoid reminders of trauma, such as certain places, people, activities, or conversations. While avoidance provides temporary relief, it can maintain PTSD and CPTSD symptoms over time.

**Attachment**
The emotional bond formed between a child and their primary caregiver. Secure attachment provides a foundation for healthy emotional development. Trauma, particularly early relational trauma, can disrupt attachment and lead to attachment difficulties in adulthood.

**Attachment Disorder**
A condition resulting from inadequate emotional bonding during early childhood, often due to neglect, abuse, or frequent changes in caregivers. Individuals with attachment disorders may struggle with trust, emotional regulation, and forming healthy relationships.

## B

**Betrayal Trauma**
Trauma inflicted by someone in a position of trust or authority, such as a parent, teacher, or intimate partner. Betrayal trauma is particularly damaging because it violates the expectation of safety within a trusted relationship.

**Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)**
A mental health condition characterized by unstable relationships, intense fear of abandonment, unstable self-image, impulsive behaviors, and emotional dysregulation. CPTSD and BPD share significant symptom overlap, particularly in emotional dysregulation and relationship difficulties, though they are distinct diagnoses.

**Brainspotting**
A psychotherapy technique that uses eye position to access and process traumatic memories. The therapist identifies "brainspots" (eye positions) that correspond to trauma processing, helping the brain process and release traumatic material.

## C

**Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)**
An evidence-based trauma therapy that helps individuals process traumatic memories by examining and challenging unhelpful thoughts related to the trauma. CPT typically involves 12 sessions and has strong evidence for treating PTSD and CPTSD.

**Complex PTSD (CPTSD)**
A mental health condition that develops following prolonged, repeated, or cumulative trauma, often involving interpersonal harm. CPTSD includes core PTSD symptoms plus disturbances in self-organization, including affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and relationship difficulties.

**Cumulative Trauma**
The combined impact of multiple traumatic events experienced over time. The total trauma burden (quantity and severity of trauma exposure) is a key predictor of CPTSD development.

## D

**Depersonalization**
A dissociative symptom where individuals feel detached from their body or physical sensations. They may feel like they are observing themselves from outside their body or that their body is unreal or unfamiliar.

**Derealization**
A dissociative symptom where the external world feels unreal, dreamlike, or visually distorted. Individuals may feel disconnected from their surroundings or perceive the world as if watching it through a fog.

**Dissociation**
A psychological response to trauma where the mind disconnects from thoughts, feelings, memories, or sense of identity as a protective mechanism. Dissociation can range from mild (daydreaming) to severe (dissociative identity disorder).

**Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**
A severe dissociative disorder characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states or identities. DID typically develops in response to severe, prolonged trauma during childhood and is one of the most severe forms of dissociation.

## E

**Emotional Flashback**
A sudden, intense emotional state triggered by a reminder of trauma, without necessarily involving visual or sensory flashbacks. The individual may suddenly feel intense fear, rage, or despair as if the trauma is happening in the present moment.

**Emancipatory Trauma Therapy**
A therapeutic approach that emphasizes the client's agency, resilience, and capacity for healing. This approach contrasts with pathology-focused models and recognizes the client's expertise in their own recovery.

**EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)**
An evidence-based psychotherapy that uses bilateral stimulation (eye movements, tapping, or sounds) to help process traumatic memories. EMDR is effective for treating PTSD and CPTSD and typically requires 8-12 sessions.

**Exposure Therapy**
A trauma therapy technique where individuals gradually confront trauma-related memories, thoughts, or situations in a safe, controlled environment. Prolonged Exposure (PE) is a specific form of exposure therapy with strong evidence for treating PTSD and CPTSD.

## F

**Flashback**
An intrusive memory of trauma that feels as if the traumatic event is happening in the present moment. Flashbacks can involve visual, sensory, emotional, or somatic components and are a core symptom of PTSD and CPTSD.

**Freeze Response**
One of the body's automatic responses to threat, characterized by immobility or "playing dead." The freeze response is controlled by the dorsal vagal system and is common in individuals who experienced inescapable trauma.

## G

**Grounding Techniques**
Coping strategies used to bring awareness back to the present moment when experiencing dissociation, flashbacks, or anxiety. Common grounding techniques include the 5-4-3-2-1 method (identifying 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you feel, 2 you smell, 1 you taste).

## H

**Hyperarousal**
A state of heightened physiological arousal where the nervous system remains in a state of alert. Individuals with hyperarousal may experience difficulty sleeping, startle easily, feel constantly on edge, or have difficulty concentrating.

**Hypervigilance**
A symptom of PTSD and CPTSD characterized by constant scanning for danger or threats. Individuals with hypervigilance may be overly alert to their surroundings, anticipate danger, and have difficulty relaxing.

## I

**Intergenerational Trauma**
Trauma that is transmitted from one generation to the next, often through parenting patterns, family dynamics, or genetic predisposition. Children of parents with CPTSD may be at higher risk for developing CPTSD themselves.

**Intrusive Thoughts**
Unwanted, involuntary thoughts related to trauma that repeatedly enter consciousness. Intrusive thoughts are a core symptom of PTSD and CPTSD and can be distressing and difficult to control.

## J

**Journaling**
A therapeutic technique where individuals write about their thoughts, feelings, and experiences related to trauma. Journaling can help process emotions, identify patterns, and support healing.

## K

**Kindness-Based Therapy**
A therapeutic approach that emphasizes self-compassion, acceptance, and kindness toward oneself. This approach is particularly helpful for individuals with CPTSD who struggle with shame and negative self-concept.

## L

**Limbic System**
The part of the brain responsible for processing emotions and memories, including the amygdala (fear center), hippocampus (memory), and hypothalamus (stress response). Trauma affects the limbic system, leading to heightened emotional reactivity and memory difficulties.

## M

**Mindfulness**
A practice of present-moment awareness without judgment. Mindfulness-based interventions can help individuals with CPTSD develop emotional regulation skills and reduce anxiety.

**Moral Injury**
Psychological harm resulting from actions, inactions, or witnessing of actions that violate one's moral code. Moral injury is common in military personnel, first responders, and healthcare workers and can co-occur with CPTSD.

## N

**Negative Self-Concept**
A core symptom of CPTSD characterized by persistent negative beliefs about oneself, including feelings of shame, guilt, worthlessness, and being fundamentally damaged. Negative self-concept often results from prolonged interpersonal trauma.

**Neurobiology of Trauma**
The study of how trauma affects brain structure and function. Trauma can alter the amygdala (fear processing), hippocampus (memory), and prefrontal cortex (rational thinking), leading to the symptoms of PTSD and CPTSD.

## O

**Occupational Trauma**
Repeated trauma exposure in a professional context, such as in first responders (police, firefighters, paramedics), healthcare workers, or military personnel. Occupational trauma can lead to CPTSD if exposure is prolonged and severe.

## P

**Phase-Based Treatment**
A structured approach to trauma therapy that occurs in phases: stabilization and skill-building, trauma processing, and integration and consolidation. Phase-based treatment is often recommended for individuals with severe CPTSD or multiple comorbidities.

**Post-Traumatic Growth**
Positive psychological change experienced as a result of struggling with challenging life circumstances. Individuals with CPTSD may experience increased empathy, stronger relationships, greater appreciation for life, personal strength, and spiritual growth through recovery.

**Prefrontal Cortex**
The part of the brain responsible for rational thinking, decision-making, and impulse control. Trauma can impair prefrontal cortex functioning, leading to difficulty with emotional regulation and decision-making.

**Prolonged Exposure (PE) Therapy**
An evidence-based trauma therapy where individuals gradually confront trauma-related memories and situations. PE typically involves 8-15 sessions and has strong evidence for treating PTSD and CPTSD.

**PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)**
A mental health condition that develops following a single traumatic event. PTSD includes symptoms of re-experiencing (flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance, negative mood changes, and hyperarousal. PTSD is distinct from CPTSD, which develops from prolonged, repeated trauma.

## R

**Resilience**
The capacity to recover from adversity and adapt to challenging circumstances. Resilience factors that predict better CPTSD outcomes include social support, coping skills, sense of purpose, and self-compassion.

**Re-experiencing**
A core symptom of PTSD and CPTSD where individuals involuntarily relive traumatic memories through flashbacks, nightmares, or intrusive thoughts. Re-experiencing makes it feel as if the trauma is happening in the present moment.

## S

**Self-Compassion**
The practice of treating oneself with kindness and understanding, particularly during times of difficulty or failure. Self-compassion is crucial in CPTSD recovery because trauma often creates harsh self-judgment and shame.

**Shame**
An intense emotional state characterized by feeling fundamentally flawed, worthless, or unlovable. Shame is often described as the most painful emotion in CPTSD and is central to the negative self-concept symptom.

**Somatic Experiencing**
A body-based psychotherapy approach that focuses on releasing trauma stored in the nervous system. Somatic Experiencing helps individuals develop awareness of bodily sensations and complete the stress response cycle.

**Somatic Symptoms**
Physical symptoms without a clear medical cause, often resulting from trauma. Individuals with CPTSD may experience chronic pain, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, or other body-based complaints.

**STAIR Therapy (Structured Trauma-Informed Affect Regulation)**
A phase-based trauma therapy that focuses on stabilization, affect regulation, and trauma processing. STAIR is particularly effective for individuals with severe CPTSD or multiple comorbidities.

**Startle Response**
An automatic reaction to sudden, unexpected stimuli. Individuals with CPTSD often have an exaggerated startle response due to hyperarousal and hypervigilance.

**Stress Response Cycle**
The body's natural process of responding to a threat and returning to baseline. Trauma can interrupt this cycle, leaving the nervous system stuck in a state of activation.

## T

**Trauma**
An overwhelming experience that exceeds an individual's capacity to cope, resulting in lasting psychological effects. Trauma can be single-event (PTSD) or prolonged and repeated (CPTSD).

**Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)**
An evidence-based psychotherapy that combines cognitive-behavioral techniques with trauma processing. TF-CBT typically involves 12-16 sessions and has strong evidence for treating PTSD and CPTSD in children and adults.

**Trauma-Informed Care**
An approach to healthcare and social services that recognizes the widespread impact of trauma and understands potential paths for recovery. Trauma-informed care emphasizes safety, trustworthiness, peer support, collaboration, empowerment, and cultural sensitivity.

**Trauma Memory**
Memories of traumatic events that are often fragmented, sensory-based, and difficult to verbalize. Trauma memories are processed differently than normal memories and are stored in implicit (non-verbal) memory systems.

**Trigger**
A reminder of trauma that activates trauma-related symptoms. Triggers can be sensory (sounds, smells, sights), contextual (places, people), or internal (emotions, physical sensations).

## U

**Unresolved Trauma**
Trauma that has not been adequately processed through therapy or other healing modalities. Unresolved trauma can lead to ongoing PTSD or CPTSD symptoms and may be transmitted intergenerationally.

## V

**Vagal Tone**
The function of the vagus nerve, which is central to the parasympathetic nervous system. Good vagal tone is associated with emotional regulation, relaxation, and social engagement. Trauma can impair vagal tone, leading to difficulty with emotional regulation.

**Ventral Vagal System**
The part of the vagus nerve associated with the parasympathetic nervous system and social engagement. Activation of the ventral vagal system promotes relaxation, safety, and social connection.

## W

**Window of Tolerance**
The zone of arousal in which an individual can function optimally. When arousal is too high (hyperarousal) or too low (hypoarousal), individuals move outside their window of tolerance, leading to dysregulation. Trauma narrows the window of tolerance.

## X

**X-Trauma (Complex Trauma)**
Another term for Complex PTSD, emphasizing the complexity and multiplicity of trauma exposure. X-trauma acknowledges that individuals have experienced multiple, interconnected traumatic events.

## Y

**Yoga (Trauma-Informed)**
A mind-body practice adapted for trauma survivors that emphasizes safety, choice, and body awareness. Trauma-informed yoga can help individuals with CPTSD develop emotional regulation skills and reconnect with their bodies.

## Z

**Zero-Sum Thinking**
A cognitive distortion common in CPTSD where individuals see situations as all-or-nothing, with no middle ground. For example, "If I'm not perfect, I'm a failure." This thinking pattern often results from trauma and can be addressed through cognitive therapy.
